Welcome to my AI in python repository!
My name is Vinicius, I'm a college student of Information Systems in Brazil.

In this repository I'm trying to show some knowledge I'm learning throughout my studies during off season
AI is a passion for me, and I'll be posting everything I do related to this subject.

I hope you enjoy it, you can contact me by Linkedn(it's in my profile) to give some feedback, advises, or anything you want
I'll answer it pretty fast and be so grateful for you spending some time to help me grow
